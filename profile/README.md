# AR Patterns

> Event-driven Design Patterns in Creating Augmented Reality Experiences

## Purpose of this Repository
The purpose of this repository is to document, maintain and extend the [catalog of AR patterns](https://github.com/ARpatterns/catalog) first published in the paper: ["AR Patterns: Event-Driven Design Patterns in Creating Augmented Reality Experiences"](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-48495-7_6).

## What are AR Patterns?
AR patterns encompass high-level design patterns covering fundamental concepts for crafting immersive AR experiences. AR patterns serve as a valuable means of communicating proven, reusable solutions to recurring design problems encountered during AR development. A list of AR patterns is collected in a public catalog, including technical as well as User Experience (UX) aspects. AR pattern diagrams foster a consistent presentation and technology-agnostic documentation of AR design patterns. The AR patterns in the catalog are illustrated by text descriptions, visuals of spatial scenarios, pattern diagrams and UI examples. Additionally AR patterns may be examplified by platform-specific source code samples.

## Structure of this Repository
This project is split into three repositories:
* The [catalog](https://github.com/ARpatterns/catalog/), which contains the catalog of AR patterns
* The [diagram](https://github.com/ARpatterns/diagram/), which describes the way of documenting patterns in the form of markdown diagrams
* The [landingpage](https://github.com/ARpatterns/landingpage/), which is hosted at [arpatterns.dev](https://arpatterns.dev)

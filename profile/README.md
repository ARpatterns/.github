# AR Patterns

> Event-driven Design Patterns in Creating Augmented Reality Experiences

## What are AR Patterns?
AR patterns encompass high-level design patterns covering fundamental concepts for crafting immersive AR experiences. AR patterns serve as a valuable means of communicating proven, reusable solutions to recurring design problems encountered during AR development. A list of AR patterns is collected in a public catalog, including technical as well as User Experience (UX) aspects. AR pattern diagrams foster a consistent presentation and technology-agnostic documentation of AR design patterns. The AR patterns in the catalog are illustrated by text descriptions, visuals of spatial scenarios, pattern diagrams and UI examples. Additionally AR patterns may be examplified by platform-specific source code samples.

The purpose of the following repositories is to document, maintain and extend the [catalog of AR Patterns](https://github.com/ARpatterns/catalog) first published in the paper: ["AR Patterns: Event-Driven Design Patterns in Creating Augmented Reality Experiences"](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-48495-7_6).

### AR Patterns - Reusable Concepts for immersive AR Experiences
The theoretical concepts of AR Patterns are reflected in these repositories:
* <strong>[catalog](https://github.com/ARpatterns/catalog/), which contains the catalog of AR patterns</strong>
* [diagram](https://github.com/ARpatterns/diagram/), which describes the way of documenting patterns in the form of markdown diagrams
* [landingpage](https://github.com/ARpatterns/landingpage/), which is the Web page hosted at [arpatterns.dev](https://arpatterns.dev)

### AR Scenarios - Technology-specific Use Cases of AR Patterns
AR Patterns applied in specific technologies:
<!--  * [scenarios](https://github.com/ARpatterns/catalog/scenarios.md), which lists typical application scenarios using various AR patterns -->

## How to Contribute
This is a community-driven initiative, which means we need you as a contributor! We would love to see more examples of AR patterns applied in other technologies. Join us in documenting new patterns and enhancing the existing ones.

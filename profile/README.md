# AR Patterns

> *Event-driven Design Patterns in Creating Augmented Reality Experiences*

## What are AR Patterns?
AR patterns encompass high-level design patterns covering fundamental concepts for crafting immersive Augmented Reality (AR) experiences. AR patterns serve as a valuable means of communicating proven, reusable solutions to recurring design problems encountered during AR development. A list of AR patterns is collected in a public catalog, including technical as well as User Experience (UX) aspects. Event-Condition-Action (ECA) is the core pattern to analyze and describe the behavior and interactivity of AR experiences. ECA diagrams foster a consistent presentation and technology-agnostic documentation of applied AR design patterns. The AR patterns in the catalog are documented by their title, a text description, illustration of the spatial scenario, and ECA diagram (as a kind of pseudo code). 

The purpose of the following repositories is to document, maintain and extend the [catalog of AR Patterns](https://github.com/ARpatterns/catalog) first published in the paper: ["AR Patterns: Event-Driven Design Patterns in Creating Augmented Reality Experiences"](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-48495-7_6). Additionally it provides reusable building blocks to illustrate and describe AR scenarios. 

## What are AR Scenarios?
An "AR scenario" in the context of AR Patterns refers to a detailed documentation of a specific scenario where combined AR patterns are applied with a particular HW/SW technology platform. It outlines how these elements are used to achieve a defined goal by creating a spatial AR user experience. An AR scenario includes sample screen recording, title, use case category, detailed description, explanatory illustration, enumeration of used AR patterns, ECA diagrams, and a sample project with source code and media assets to demonstrate the practical application of AR patterns.


## Table of Contents

### AR Patterns - Reusable Building Blocks for immersive AR Experiences
The concepts of AR Patterns are reflected in these repositories:
* [**catalog**](https://github.com/ARpatterns/catalog/) that lists [augmentation patterns](https://github.com/ARpatterns/catalog/#augmentation-patterns), [behavioral patterns](https://github.com/ARpatterns/catalog/#behavioral-patterns), and the core [Event-Condition-Action pattern](https://github.com/ARpatterns/catalog/#event-condition-action-pattern) used in AR experiences
* [**diagram**](https://github.com/ARpatterns/diagram/) which describes the way of documenting AR patterns in the form of Event-Condition-Action diagrams using markdown syntax
* [**illustration**](https://github.com/ARpatterns/Illustrations/): a toolbox for creating custom illustrations of AR scenarios
* [use cases](https://github.com/ARpatterns/catalog/blob/main/usecases.md) listing use case categories of AR scenarios
* [technology platforms](https://github.com/ARpatterns/catalog/blob/main/platforms.md) listing available technology platforms that showcase scenarios using various AR patterns

## How to Contribute
This is a community-driven initiative, which means we need you as a contributor! We would love to see more examples of AR patterns applied in other technologies. Join us in documenting new patterns and enhancing the existing ones.

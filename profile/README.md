> Event-driven Design Patterns in Creating Augmented Reality Experiences

## What are AR Patterns?
AR patterns encompass high-level design patterns covering fundamental concepts for crafting immersive AR experiences. AR patterns serve as a valuable means of communicating proven, reusable solutions to recurring design problems encountered during AR development. A list of AR patterns is collected in a public catalog, including technical as well as User Experience (UX) aspects. AR pattern diagrams foster a consistent presentation and technology-agnostic documentation of AR design patterns. The AR patterns in the catalog are documented by their titles, text descriptions, illustrations of spatial scenarios, pattern diagrams (as a kind of pseudo code) and UI examples. 

The purpose of the following repositories is to document, maintain and extend the [catalog of AR Patterns](https://github.com/ARpatterns/catalog) first published in the paper: ["AR Patterns: Event-Driven Design Patterns in Creating Augmented Reality Experiences"](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-48495-7_6).

## What are AR Scenarios?
An "AR scenario" in the context of AR Patterns refers to a detailed documentation of a specific scenario where combined AR patterns are applied with a particular HW/SW technology platform. It outlines how these elements are used to achieve a defined goal by creating a spatial AR user experience. An AR scenario includes sample screen recording, title, use case category, detailed description, explanatory illustration, used AR patterns, AR pattern diagram, and sample project with source code and media assets to demonstrate the practical application of AR patterns.


## Table of Contents

### AR Patterns - Reusable Concepts for immersive AR Experiences
The theoretical concepts of AR Patterns are reflected in these repositories:
* [**catalog**](https://github.com/ARpatterns/catalog/), which contains the catalog of basic AR patterns
* [diagram](https://github.com/ARpatterns/diagram/), which describes the way of documenting patterns in the form of markdown diagrams
* [use cases](https://github.com/ARpatterns/catalog/blob/main/usecases.md), which lists use case categories of scenarios that are using various AR patterns
* [technology platforms](https://github.com/ARpatterns/catalog/blob/main/platforms.md), which lists available technology platforms that showcase scenarios using various AR patterns 

<!--* [landingpage](https://github.com/ARpatterns/landingpage/), which is the Web page hosted at [arpatterns.dev](https://arpatterns.dev)  -->

### AR Scenarios - Technology-specific Use Cases of AR Patterns
AR Patterns applied with specific technologies:
* No-Code

* Low-Code
  * AR Patterns in DeclARe using [**ARchi VR** App](https://github.com/ARpatterns/declare/)
* Full-Code
  * AR Patterns in **AR.js** using WebXR/A-Frame/three.js
  * AR Patterns in C# using Unity/ARFoundation

## How to Contribute
This is a community-driven initiative, which means we need you as a contributor! We would love to see more examples of AR patterns applied in other technologies. Join us in documenting new patterns and enhancing the existing ones.
